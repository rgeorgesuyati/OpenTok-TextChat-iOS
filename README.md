## Integration with existing project

```
@interface ViewController ()
{
    SYOpenTokClient *client;
}

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    self.chatArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
    client = [[SYOpenTokClient alloc] initWithKey:KAPI_KEY
                                        sessionId:KSESSION_ID
                                            token:KSESSION_TOKEN 
                                         delegate:self];

}
```
* To send a message

```
[client sendMessage:message withSignalType:@"chat" toConnection:nil];

params: 

message: The data to send

signalType: The type of the signal 

connection: A destination OTConnection object. (Use this to send a message to specific user).
```
* Implement the delegate method 
```
- (void)chatSession:(OTSession*)session
 receivedSignalType:(NSString*)type
     fromConnection:(OTConnection*)connection
         withString:(NSString*)string
           isAuthor:(BOOL)isAuthor;
  ```
  
* When message is send or received, this delegate method will be called. You can check the author flag to identify the creator of the message.
